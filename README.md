Parsing text

The following string is given to represent the data of three people:

string text = "John.Davidson/Berlin Michael.Barton/Lisbon Ivan.Perkinson/Moscow".

In short, the program should be works as follows:

1.Divide a given string into several parts to get names, surnames and cities (split function) = done

2.Use the obtained data to create three objects of type Person 

(it's needed the Person class to make with the constructor, and the get and set methods)

3.Objects that you get, need to put in one Person[] array

4.And the end, you go through a array of people and display their data at the exit.

Output should look like this:

John Davidson Berlin

Michael Barton Lisbon

Ivan Perkinson Moscow

It must also be used  .NET 5 SDK, not .NET 6.

The task should be done in this order because it should be understandable to beginners.
